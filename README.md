<h1>Resolving Tickets in osTicket</h1>
We will go through the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

In this instance an End user/customer has reported an issue. The customer will login to the Help Desk portal and create a Ticket from this link [http://localhost/osTicket](http://localhost/osTicket ) and open a new ticket.
User will have to enter Contact information and a Help topic as to what is going on.
From that point the User will have to report the issue as best as they can with as much information that is most helpful and then they will create the Support Ticket.

When resolving tickets, it is important to have strong communication. One has to communicate with their team and the affected users. Tickets come and go with different issues and are assigned appropriately to different people.  Documentation is crucial to a successful environment. Tickets need to be documented properly so they can be used as reference if a similar issue shows up in the future.

The protocols for how tickets are managed can differ depending on the work environment. There may be a quota for how many tickets need to be resolved within a certain time frame and certain tickets will have to be prioritized depending on the situation. I have built osTicket from scratch and was able to understand how tickets work in an IT position.# Ticket-Lifecycle
